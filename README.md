# Financial Instability in an Agent-Based Model: AI-Driven Banking Strategies and Systemic Risk

## Objective

This repository supports the research article **"Financial Instability in an Agent-Based Model: AI-Driven Banking Strategies and Systemic Risk"**. The study aims to explore the interaction between AI-driven banking strategies and systemic risk using an agent-based model. The model simulates decision-making processes in banks and firms under different financial regimes to evaluate the implications of financial instability.

## Model Description

The agent-based model (ABM) implemented in this study focuses on:

1. **Banking strategies**: Examining how banks decide to finance firm entries and projects based on competitive and systemic risk criteria.
2. **Firm dynamics**: Simulating firm behaviors across three financial regimes (Hedge, Speculative, and Ponzi).
3. **Systemic risk assessment**: Evaluating how financial decisions at the micro-level aggregate into systemic instability.

The simulation integrates AI-driven strategies to classify firms based on financial stability metrics, using clustering and risk management techniques to optimize bank portfolios. The model allows flexibility to test different initial conditions and parameters.

## Requirements

The model requires **LSD 8.0** (Laboratory for Simulation Development) to run. You can download LSD from its official repository:
[https://github.com/marcov64/Lsd/tree/8.0-stable-2](https://github.com/marcov64/Lsd/tree/8.0-stable-2)

Ensure LSD is properly installed. Place the files from this repository into the LSD working directory. The initial parameters are already pre-configured.

## Initial Conditions

The table below summarizes the initial conditions and parameters used in the model:

| Parameter          | Value  | Description                                   |
| ------------------ | ------ | --------------------------------------------- |

| $`\lambda`$        | 0.1    | Market share adjustment rate                  |
| $`\nu`$            | 0.95   | Forgetting rate                               |
| k groups           | 3      | Total number of groups in k-means             |
| Number of firms    | 100    | Total number of firms in the simulation       |
| Number of projects | 300    | Total number of firms projects                |

## How to Run

1. **Install LSD**:

   - Follow the installation instructions for LSD 8.0 available in its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/marcov64/Lsd/tree/8.0-stable-2).
   - Place all `src/` files from sthis repository into the LSD working directory.
   - `src/fun_ai-banking-regulation.cpp` is the main file with source code.

2. **Run the Simulation**:

   - Launch the LSD interface and load the simulation model provided in this repository.
   - Start the simulation and monitor the outputs.

3. **Analyze Results**:

   - Use the output data generated by LSD to analyze systemic risk metrics, financial regime distributions, and bank performance under different scenarios.
